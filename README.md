## Installation

Download the latest release zip file, unpack it and run the setup.exe found within. Donâ€™t be alarmed if you run into a screen like this:

![clickpuli_install](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb887bd-773a-4d59-b22a-69b2c72d3d9a)


This occurs because, this being a small hobby project, I opted not to purchase a signing key from a Certificate Authority (CA) therefore the installer is signed only with test certificates. This is why the warning is displayed by Windows.

Once the installation is complete the ClickPuli plugin should load on the next start of MS Word:

![clickpuli_menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/440686e0-9ed4-427a-bea4-7607cb7b4d35)


## Usage

The plugin provides 3 basic functions:

1.  Unselects the empty space after the word when you double click.
2.  Selects any of the provided characters before and/or after the word when you double click.
3.  Automatically copies the selected word to clipboard when you double click.

The following image illustrates where those options can be found:
